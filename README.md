# AWS-SAA notes

## AWS Global Infrastructure

### Global
To plan for high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR)
34 `Region`s -> 108 `Availability zones` -> One or more discrete `data centers` with independent and redundant power infrastructure, networking, and connectivity -> 600+ Point of Presences  

### Services scoping
`Global`: AWS IAM, AWS Organizations, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Route53, AWS Global Accelerator, AWS Direct Connect, AWS Firewall Manager, AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF), and AWS Shield
`Region scoped`: EC2 (IaaS) - Beanstalk (PaaS) - Lambda (FaaS) - Rekognition (SaaS)  

## IAM

### Entities management
`Users` can have many `Groups` and vice versa  
`Policies` define `Permissions` for an action ie: _AdministatorAccess => {Effect: Allow,  Action: {ec2: Describe, cloudwatch: GetMetricsStatistics},  Resource: *}_  
Attach policies to IAM identities (`Users`, `Groups` to which users belong, or `Roles`)  

### Password
Policy: _min length_ (upper case, lower, number) + allow IAM users to _change password_ + _expiration_ + prevent _password reuse_  
MFA = _password_ you know + _device_ you own  
- Virtual MFA: Google Authenticator (phone for multiple tokens and one device) or Authy (multi device)
- U2F (Universal 2nd factor) Yubikey by Yubico (multiple roots and users)
- Key Fob MFA device (Gemalto)  
- Key Fob MFA device (AWS Gov Cloud)  

### Accesses
`AWS Managment console` (MFA)  
`AWS CLI` (Access keys)  
`AWS SDK` (Access keys)  
Access keys generated by console: `Access key ID` ~= username & `Secret access key` ~= password  
Add permission to AWS Services with `IAM Role` (EC2, Lambda, Cloudformation)  


## EC2

### Selection

Choose CPU, RAM, storage space `EBS/EFS/EC2 instance store`, network card `speed, public IP`, firewall rules `security group`, bootstrap script `EC2 user data with root user` and Key pair creation `SSH and PEM file`

### Instance type

`General instance`: (balance between Compute, Memory and Networking)'; for Web server, code repository (T, M, A)
`Compute optimized`: Batch processing, Game server, Media transcoding, High performance web server, High computing (C)  
`Memory optimized`: High peformance database, distributed cache store, In-memory database for Business Intelligence, Application with real-time processing of big data (R, X, z)  
`Storage optimized`: High frequency OLTP system, Database, Cache for database like Redis, Dataware housing applications, Distributed file systems (i, D, H1)

### Security Group

Act as a `Firewall` - Locked down to a region - Time out due to security group issue  
`Inbound` (default traffic is `Blocked`) and `Outbound` (default traffic is `Allowed`) rules for white listing of `Type`, `Protocol`, `Port`, `Source`  
Same security group instances are `Allowed`  
Good to maintain one security group dedicated to SSH access  

### SSH

`SSH`  
`Direct Connect`: (Simple web short lived SSH connection)  
`Session Manager`: Enable AWS CLI to establish SSH + Transfer files via SCP + use IAM policies to explicitly allow or deny users, groups, or roles to make SSH connections using Session Manager
